 📰 Fake News Detection

📌 Project Overview
The Fake News Detection project aims to detect whether a given news article is real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms.  
This project helps identify misinformation and promotes media credibility.

---

 🎯 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that classifies news articles as Fake or Real based on their textual content.

---

 ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- TfidfVectorizer
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest / Gradient Boosting

---

 🧠 Workflow
1. Data Collection – Used a Kaggle dataset containing true and fake news articles.  
2. Data Preprocessing – Cleaned text data by removing punctuation, stopwords, and performing stemming/lemmatization.  
3. Feature Extraction – Converted textual data into numeric form using TF-IDF Vectorizer.  
4. Model Building – Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.  
5. Evaluation – Compared model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
6. Prediction – Classified unseen text as *Fake* or *Real*.

 📊 Results
✅ Achieved up to ~98% accuracy using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF.  
✅ Balanced Precision and Recall performance on the validation set.
